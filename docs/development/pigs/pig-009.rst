Abstract
========

- create event simulator 
- required by the CTA Science Tools
- needed to simulate the DC2


Proposal
========

- the design follows the ASTRIsim
- expected source counts cube for a given spectrum and morphology, prior the application of the IRF
(- the counts-cube can be associated to a light-curve)
- expected background counts cube evaluated from the IRF
- the energy dispersion is applied to the source counts
- the PSF is applied to the source counts
- source and background events are stacked together 
- write them all into an event list file (.fits)


Alternatives
============



Decision
